MongoDB-CRUD-Operations-with-Python-GUI

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. The application should allow users to manage student records in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a modern desktop application that enables seamless interaction with a MongoDB database. This will help users to efficiently insert, retrieve, update, and delete records while maintaining a clean and modern user interface.

ðŸ’» Software and Hardware Requirements

Software Requirements	

Python 3.x	

CustomTkinter

PyMongo

MongoDB (Community)	

Hardware Requirements

Laptop/PC with minimum 4GB RAM

Dual-core processor

500MB free disk space


ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python â€“ Programming language for application logic

CustomTkinter â€“ Modern GUI framework for Python

PyMongo â€“ MongoDB driver for Python

MongoDB â€“ NoSQL database for storing student data

âœ¨ Features

Add new flight records to MongoDB

View all records in a modern table view

Update existing records

Delete records

Responsive and modern UI with light/dark mode support

ðŸ“œ Output Explanation

The application provides a form to enter Flight Number, Name, Origin, Destination, Departure, Arrival, Status & Terminal/Gate. Users can:

Insert new records

View them in a tabular format

Update existing entries

Delete them easily

The Treeview widget is used for displaying data in a structured way. Clicking on a row loads the data into the form for editing. 
CustomTkinter provides a clean and modern interface for the GUI.

âœ… Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the integration of MongoDB with a Python GUI application for managing student data. 
The use of CustomTkinter ensures the interface is visually appealing and user-friendly. 
CRUD operations are performed efficiently, making the application suitable for small-scale database management tasks.
